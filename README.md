- 👋 Hi, I’m @innerwebblueprint
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, javacript, php, and how to turn my ideas into something programatically functional.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most anything related to Hive (the blockchain), and what I call 'soverign computing'... which essentially is FOSS.
- 📫 How to reach me ... https://www.innerwebblueprint.com/
